# Application Of Water level monitoring and controlling 

- Can be used in water reservoirs to control water levels.
- Can be used in factories, commercial complexes, apartments, homes.
- Helps to keep track of water level.
- Automattion helps in ease of work and maintenance.

## Microcontroller
-  Arduino UNO is a low-cost, flexible, and easy-to-use programmable open-source microcontroller board that can be integrated into a variety of electronic projects. Performs all operations required by our system. Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It has 14 digital input/output pins, 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button..

## Application of Arduino Uno

- Arduino uno is a board that is mainly used to develop embedded systems.
- Its used in all the fields.
- Can be used for HomeAutomation.
- Its used in IoT based projects.

## A Ultrasonic sensor(water proof)
- An ultrasonic sensor is an electronic device that measures the distance of a target object by emitting ultrasonic sound waves, and converts the reflected sound into an electrical signal. Ultrasonic waves travel faster than the speed of audible sound (i.e. the sound that humans can hear). Ultrasonic sensors have two main components: the transmitter and the receiver.

## Application of Ultrasonic sensor(HC-SR04)

- They are used within food and beverage to measure liquid level in bottles.
- They can be used within manufacturing for an automated process and control maximising efficiency on the factory floor.
- can be used for Detecting breaks in threads or wires.
- used for counting people/people detection.

## A stepper motor
- A stepper motor is a brushless DC electric motor that divides a full rotation into a number of equal steps. In this project it is used as a refence to gates of dam.

## Application of servo motor
- Used in Robotics.
- Used with Conveyor Belts.
- Used for Camera Auto Focus.
- Used in Antenna positioning. 
- Used in printers, Automatic doors etc.

## LCD 
- LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is a type of flat panel display which uses liquid crystals in its primary form of operation. It consists of segments of a liquid crystal whose reflectivity varies according to the voltage applied to them. It is a flat-panel display or other electronically modulated optical device that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals combined with polarizers.

## Applications of LCD(Liquid Crystal Display)

- The liquid crystal displays(LCD) are used in aircraft cockpit displays.
- It is used as a display screen in calculators.
- For displaying images used in digital cameras.
- The television is main applications of LCD.
- Mostly the computer monitor is made up of LCD.
- It is used in instrumental panel where all the lab instruments uses LCD screens for display.
- The LCD's are used in all digital wrist watches for displaying time.

## Buzzer
- An arduino buzzer is also called a piezo buzzer. It is basically a tiny speaker that we can connect directly to an Arduino. We can make it sound a tone at a frequency you set. The buzzer produces sound based on reverse of the piezoelectric effect. Here in this project it is used as a alarm.


## Requirments:
- System: micro controller.
- Sub system: motion sensor, Actuator.

### High Level Requirements
- To get waterlevel of dam using ultrasonic sensors.
- To make decisions whether to turn ON/OFF the gate. 

### Low level requirments:
- Send and Receive signal from sensor.
- Calculate level.
- Switches to turn ON/OFF the system.
- Power Supply to the Microcontroller, Sensors and Actuators.
