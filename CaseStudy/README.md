# Case study on Water level monitoring and Control system 

### Microcontroller
- Performs all operations required by our system. It takes distance as input and controls the gate and buzzer when the threshold is crossed.

### A Ultrasonic sensor(water proof)
- An ultrasonic sensor is an instrument that measures the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound waves.

### A stepper motor
- A stepper motor is a brushless DC electric motor that divides a full rotation into a number of equal steps. In this project it is used as a refence to gates of dam.

### Buzzer
- It is basically a tiny speaker and makes a beep sound, in this project it's used as alarm.
