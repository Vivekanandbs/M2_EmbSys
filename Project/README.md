# Water level monitoring and controlling Project

## Introduction 
 Water level monitoring and controlling is a simple embedded project which can be used in water reservoirs. This project uses arduino uno as the microcontroller and a waterproof Ultrasonic sensor to monitor the level of the water. A servo motor is used as gate of dam and there is also use of led and buzzer to indicate if the water level is too high and the gate is closed.


### Microcontroller
- Performs all operations required by our system. It takes distance as input and controls the gate and buzzer when the threshold is crossed.

### A Ultrasonic sensor(water proof)
- An ultrasonic sensor is an instrument that measures the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound waves.

### A servo motor
- A stepper motor is a brushless DC electric motor that divides a full rotation into a number of equal steps. In this project it is used as a refence to gates of dam.

### Buzzer
- It is basically a tiny speaker and makes a beep sound, in this project it's used as alarm.
