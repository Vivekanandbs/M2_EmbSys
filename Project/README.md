# Water level monitoring and controlling Project

## Introduction 
 Water level monitoring and controlling is a simple embedded project which can be used in water reservoirs. This project uses arduino uno as the microcontroller and a waterproof Ultrasonic sensor to monitor the level of the water. A servo motor is used as gate of dam and there is also use of led and buzzer to indicate if the water level is too high and the gate is closed.

## Components Required 

### Microcontroller Arduino Uno
- Arduino UNO is a low-cost, flexible, and easy-to-use programmable open-source microcontroller board that can be integrated into a variety of electronic projects. Performs all operations required by our system. Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It has 14 digital input/output pins, 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button.

### A Ultrasonic sensor(water proof)
- An ultrasonic sensor is an electronic device that measures the distance of a target object by emitting ultrasonic sound waves, and converts the reflected sound into an electrical signal. Ultrasonic waves travel faster than the speed of audible sound (i.e. the sound that humans can hear). Ultrasonic sensors have two main components: the transmitter and the receiver.

### A servo motor
- A servomotor (or servo motor) is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration. It consists of a suitable motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback. It also requires a relatively sophisticated controller, often a dedicated module designed specifically for use with servomotors. A servomotor is a closed-loop servomechanism that uses position feedback to control its motion and final position. The input to its control is a signal (either analogue or digital) representing the position commanded for the output shaft.

### LCD 
- LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is a type of flat panel display which uses liquid crystals in its primary form of operation. It consists of segments of a liquid crystal whose reflectivity varies according to the voltage applied to them. It is a flat-panel display or other electronically modulated optical device that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals combined with polarizers.

### Buzzer
- An arduino buzzer is also called a piezo buzzer. It is basically a tiny speaker that we can connect directly to an Arduino. We can make it sound a tone at a frequency you set. The buzzer produces sound based on reverse of the piezoelectric effect. Here in this project it is used as a alarm.

### LED
- LEDs are small, powerful lights that are used in many different applications. To start, we will work on blinking an LED, the Hello World of microcontrollers. It is as simple as turning a light on and off.
