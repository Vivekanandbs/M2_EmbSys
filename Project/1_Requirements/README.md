## SWOT analysis

### Strength
- Water reservoirs can be automated.
- Automation of dams would ease the work.
- It would help the supervisors to have clear picture about what is happening.

### Weakness
- Difficulties might arrise when there are powercuts.
- Cost of the system might increase as we might need water proof components. 

### Opportunities
- This project is not only applicable to water reservoirs but can also be used in other fields.
- The idea can be used when there is a storage limit and can be modified accordingly.

### Threats 
- Misfunctioning of the system might cause disasters.
